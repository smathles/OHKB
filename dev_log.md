## 2024/12/24:
I have decided to use Onshape as the main platform to share CAD files. This is for a multitude of reasons:
- Solidworks: Great, but barely any hobbyists have access to it (v. expensive licence, no free options).
- Fusion: Great, but unfortunately its workflow is significantly different to Onshape/Inventor/Solidworks WRT assemblies and other factors. I don't know it well enough to make high-quality models quite frankly.
- Onshape: Great, only downside is it's 100% cloud-based, so no native file format exports (only STEP/STL/etc).

As I have used both Onshape and Solidworks extensively, I will be proceeding with Onshape to better facilitate open-source development and modifications! As it is free for hobbyists to use, I will host the project there and export STEP models to this repository.
