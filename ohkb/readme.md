# OHKB

An open-source split keyboard, inspired by the [dygma raise](https://dygma.com/pages/dygma-raise-2), [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/), and the [Happy Hacking Keyboard](https://hhkeyboard.us/) (as well as a stubborn insistance that '6' should be typed with one's right hand).
